# FASTA-Parser

Program designed to take in a large text file of DNA sequences and parse each sequence under two requirements:

1. The sequence is not empty/length of 0 nucleotides.
2. The sequence is at least 250 nucleotides in length.

The program also outputs the resulting DNA sequences in a format that is easily interpreted by NCBI's BLAST tools.

Database:
- Directory containing all the DNA sequences in a text file as a database for the program

Output:
- Directory to store the output of the program in a text file

src:
- Directory containing all the source code in Java
